SequelizeCraigslistCars
=======================

Insert all of the current Boston Craigslist posts in the car section (sold by owner) into an SQL database (Postgres).

To execute:

- Have a local Postgres instance running
- Run `python main.py &`
- Check your database! All of the current cars on Cragslist (Boston) should be there.

Note: this utility is almost entirely for my own enjoyment:
I wanted to optimize my car buying experience using SQL - and make better decisons. If you want to keep this running as a daemon, your database can update as more car posts are made.

Good luck!
